          Focused on IoT, UX/UI, mobile computing, and microservices. For my
          Master’s thesis, I built a scalable system to control and monitor IoT
          devices—think smart pool sensors chatting over MQTT. This was
          supported by a research scholarship with LASIGE. Relevant topics I
          explored: IoT, UX/UI, mobile computing, microservices, and game
          development.
